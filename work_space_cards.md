# **Math Kit Workspace Cards**


This whole project has been done using the [**tkinter**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) library for the GUI in Python.

<br>


## **Calculator**

This workspace card deploys a regular calculator for performing simple and a bit more advanced operations, using the [**tkinter**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) library for the GUI in Python and the [**math**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) library in Python for performing mathematical operations.

While keeping track of the history of the operations, and allowing the user to go back to the previous operations, or clearing the result to perform another one.

Whilst the Enter button is used to carry out the mathematical operation.

Given the options of the calculator, the user can choose to perform the following operations:

    - Addition
    - Subtraction
    - Multiplication
    - Division
    - Square Root
    - Log
    - Trigonometric Functions
    - Hyperbolic Trigonometry

<br>

## **Plotter**

This workspace card is used to plot the graph of either:
   
    1. An entered list.
    2. An entered polynomial equation.
    3. Or a data set from a csv file.

       
using [**matplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org/) library, with the help of [**NumPy**](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/numpy-tutorial-python/) in Python.

This workspace offers the user the option to plot functions of the following types:

    - Linear
    - Polynomial function

<br>

## **Convertor**

This workspace card is used to perform unit conversions between a couple of common units of measurements, such as: length and temperature. Using the [**tkinter**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) library for the GUI in Python and the [**Pillow**](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow) library in Python.

## **Randomizer**

This workspace card is used to generate random lists for a given input entered by the user, using the [**tkinter**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) library for the GUI in Python, the [**random**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) library in Python and the [**NumPy**](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/numpy-tutorial-python/) library in Python.

One other feature of this workspace is that it allows adding, deleting, picking a random item to the list, and clearing the list.
